* Have all actions return error to handle in main rather then fatal
** In case any action fails, stop the full process rather then banging on

* Use phase key in run action rather then postprocess: true

* Make logging more consistent
* Have a mode to output the final yaml after templating and then exit (dry-run?)

* Rename to debos

* Documentation of all actions and overall concepts!
* Tests, individual actions are mostly testable..

* Make action naming consistent and add a stability guarantee

* Support having devices as image files (fakemachine should handle it ok)

* Create a standard docker image with debos to push to docker hub for easy
  image creation

* Template function to include other files
* Dependency system between recipes ?

* Warn on unknown yaml fields?

* New actions:
** Create a manifest from install debian packages
** Install all dbgsym packages for a given rootfs
** Install all dev package for installed libraries
** Generalize the ostree conversion into an action?
** Ostree checkout for incremental fast updates?
** Action to get remote content which can be copied in
*** Download tarball from http and unpack (same content)
*** Download git tree (e.g. to get rpi firmware)
*** Download .deb (e.g. u-boot to raw write rather then install)

* Check what triggers ostree changes and try to minimize those

* Control passwd & group contents as that can be problematic with ostree

* Rewrite debootstrap in pure go to add a bunch of smarts (e.g. parallel
  downloads, local caching etc)

* Rewrite pack/unpack in pure go and support more formats


* Split deploying root dir onto image from setup-image action

* Add description field in baseaction and print it by default

* Make actions using (host) commands check their existance early


* Ensure we copy xattrs?

* Fix race in qemu-helper

* Do shell compatible parsing of script: argument to run actions and
  environment substitution
