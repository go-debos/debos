## Description

debos is a tool to make the creation of various Debian-based OS images
simpler. While most other tools focus on specific use-cases, debos is
more meant as a tool-chain to make common actions trivial while providing
enough rope to do whatever tweaking that might be required behind the scene.

debos expects a YAML file as input and will run the actions listed in the
file sequentially. These actions should be self-contained and independent
of each other.

Some of the actions provided by debos to customize and produce images are:

* apt: install packages and their dependencies with 'apt'
* debootstrap: construct the target rootfs with debootstrap
* download: download a single file from the internet
* filesystem-deploy: deploy a root filesystem to an image previously created
* image-partition: create an image file, make partitions and format them
* ostree-commit: create an OSTree commit from rootfs
* ostree-deploy: deploy an OSTree branch to the image
* overlay: do a recursive copy of directories or files to the target filesystem
* pack: create a tarball with the target filesystem
* raw: directly write a file to the output image at a given offset
* run: allows to run a command or script in the filesystem or in the host
* unpack: unpack files from archive in the filesystem

## Simple example

The following example will create a arm64 image, install several
packages in it, change the file /etc/hostname to "debian" and finally
make a tarball.

    {{- $image := or .image "debian.tgz" -}}

    architecture: arm64

    actions:
      - action: debootstrap
        suite: "buster"
        components:
          - main
          - non-free
        mirror: https://deb.debian.org/debian
        variant: minbase

      - action: apt
        packages: [ sudo, openssh-server, adduser, systemd-sysv, firmware-linux ]

      - action: run
        chroot: true
        command: echo debian > /etc/hostname

      - action: pack
        file: {{ $image }}
        compression: gz

To run it, create a file named `example.yaml` and run:

    debos example.yaml

The final tarball will be named "debian.tgz" if you would like to modify
this name, you can provided a different name for the variable image like
this:

    debos -t image:"debian-arm64.tgz" example.yaml

## Other examples

This example builds a customized image for a Raspberry Pi 3.
