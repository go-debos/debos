.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
debos is a tool to make the creation of various Debian-based OS images
simpler.
While most other tools focus on specific use-cases, debos is designed to
be a toolchain making common actions trivial while providing enough rope
to do whatever tweaking which might be required behind the scenes.
.PP
debos expects a YAML file as input and runs the actions listed in the
file sequentially.
These actions should be self-contained and independent of each other.
.PP
Some of the actions provided by debos to customise and produce images
are:
.IP \[bu] 2
apt: install packages and their dependencies with `apt'
.IP \[bu] 2
debootstrap: construct the target rootfs with debootstrap
.IP \[bu] 2
download: download a single file from the internet
.IP \[bu] 2
filesystem-deploy: deploy a root filesystem to an image previously
created
.IP \[bu] 2
image-partition: create an image file, make partitions and format them
.IP \[bu] 2
ostree-commit: create an OSTree commit from rootfs
.IP \[bu] 2
ostree-deploy: deploy an OSTree branch to the image
.IP \[bu] 2
overlay: do a recursive copy of directories or files to the target
filesystem
.IP \[bu] 2
pack: create a tarball with the target filesystem
.IP \[bu] 2
pacman: install packages and their dependencies with pacman
.IP \[bu] 2
pacstrap: construct the target rootfs with pacstrap
.IP \[bu] 2
raw: directly write a file to the output image at a given offset
.IP \[bu] 2
recipe: includes the recipe actions at the given path
.IP \[bu] 2
run: allows to run a command or script in the filesystem or in the host
.IP \[bu] 2
unpack: unpack files from archive in the filesystem
.PP
A full syntax description of all the debos actions can be found at:
https://godoc.org/github.com/go-debos/debos/actions
.SH INSTALLATION (DOCKER CONTAINER)
.PP
An official debos container is available:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker pull godebos/debos
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See
docker/README.md (https://github.com/go-debos/debos/blob/master/docker/README.md)
for usage.
.SH INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE (UNDER DEBIAN)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo apt install golang git libglib2.0-dev libostree-dev qemu-system-x86 \[rs]
     qemu-user-static debootstrap systemd-container
export GOPATH=/opt/src/gocode # or whatever suits your needs
go install -v github.com/go-debos/debos/cmd/debos\[at]latest
/opt/src/gocode/bin/debos --help
\f[R]
.fi
.SH SIMPLE EXAMPLE
.PP
The following example will create an arm64 image, install several
packages in it, change the file /etc/hostname to \[lq]debian\[rq] and
finally make a tarball of the complete system.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{- $image := or .image \[dq]debian.tgz\[dq] -}}

architecture: arm64

actions:
  - action: debootstrap
    suite: bookworm
    components:
      - main
      - non-free-firmware
    mirror: https://deb.debian.org/debian
    variant: minbase

  - action: apt
    packages: [ sudo, openssh-server, adduser, systemd-sysv, firmware-linux ]

  - action: run
    chroot: true
    command: echo debian > /etc/hostname

  - action: pack
    file: {{ $image }}
    compression: gz
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To run it, create a file named \f[V]example.yaml\f[R] and run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
debos example.yaml
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The final tarball will be named \[lq]debian.tgz\[rq] if you would like
to modify the fileame, you can provided a different name for the
variable image like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
debos -t image:\[dq]debian-arm64.tgz\[dq] example.yaml
\f[R]
.fi
.SH OTHER EXAMPLES
.PP
Example recipes are collected in a separate repository:
.PP
https://github.com/go-debos/debos-recipes
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
debos reads a predefined list of environment variables from the host and
propagates them to the fakemachine build environemnt.
The set of environment variables is defined by \f[V]environ_vars\f[R] in
\f[V]cmd/debos/debos.go\f[R].
Currently the list of environment variables includes the proxy
environment variables documented at:
.PP
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/proxy_settings
.PP
The list of environment variables currently exported to fakemachine is:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, rsync_proxy, all_proxy, no_proxy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
While the elements of \f[V]environ_vars\f[R] are in lower case, for each
element both lower and upper case variants are probed on the host and if
found propagated to fakemachine.
So if the host has the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and no_proxy
defined, both will be propagated to fakemachine respecting the case.
.PP
The command line options \f[V]--environ-var\f[R] and \f[V]-e\f[R] can be
used to specify, overwrite and unset environment variables for
fakemachine with the syntax:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ debos -e ENVIRONVAR:VALUE ...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To unset an environment variable, or in other words, to prevent an
environment variable being propagated to fakemachine, use the same
syntax without a value.
debos accepts multiple -e simultaneously.
.SH PROXY CONFIGURATION
.PP
While the proxy related environment variables are exported from the host
to fakemachine, there are two known sources of issues:
.IP \[bu] 2
Using localhost will not work from fakemachine.
Use an address which is valid on your network.
debos will warn if the environment variables contain localhost.
.IP \[bu] 2
In case you are running applications and/or scripts inside fakemachine
you may need to check which are the proxy environment variables they
use.
Different apps are known to use different environment variable names and
different case for environment variable names.
.SH FAKEMACHINE BACKEND
.PP
debos (unless running debos with the \f[V]--disable-fakemachine\f[R]
argument) creates and spawns a virtual machine using
fakemachine (https://github.com/go-debos/fakemachine) and executes the
actions defined by the recipe inside the virtual machine.
This helps ensure recipes are reproducible no matter the host
environment.
.PP
Fakemachine can use different virtualisation backends to spawn the
virtual machine, for more information see the fakemachine
documentation (https://github.com/go-debos/fakemachine).
.PP
By default the backend will automatically be selected based on what is
supported by the host machine, but this can be overridden using the
\f[V]--fakemachine-backend\f[R] / \f[V]-b\f[R] option.
If no backends are supported, debos reverts to running the recipe on the
host without creating a fakemachine.
.PP
Performance of the backends is roughly as follows: \f[V]kvm\f[R] is
faster than \f[V]uml\f[R] is faster than \f[V]qemu\f[R].
Using \f[V]--disable-fakemachine\f[R] is slightly faster than
\f[V]kvm\f[R], but requires root permissions.
